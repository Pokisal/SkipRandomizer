Because Convicts and Cletus don't have scoops they're set as "Antique Lover" for Cletus and "Examine" for Convicts respectively in the watch

This mostly works but there is still a couple bugs and QOL things to be fixed/added.

KNOWN BUGS:
Getting Rescue The Professor into A Temporary Agreement loads the player into a void which softlocks the game. (I know what causes this but honestly no idea how exactly to fix)

Case Menu and Save Menus open multiple times. (No idea how to fix)
